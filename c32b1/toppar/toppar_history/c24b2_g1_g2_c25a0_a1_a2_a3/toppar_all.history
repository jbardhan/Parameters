Recent advances in the development of empirical force field parameters
have led to frequent updates of the all-hydrogen (all22) parameter
sets supplied with charmm.  Currently, the all-hydrogen parameters are
updated with the release of every version of charmm.  In order to
allow the user to remain current with the evolution of the parameters
and to obtain parameters from previously released versions of charmm
the following procedure in being instituted as of January 1994,
coinciding with the release of charmm versions c23f3 and c24a1.  This
system will also allow users in publicatons to specify the version of
charmm from which the parameters were obtained.  Other users will then
be able to readily obtain the particular version of the parameters and
reproduce the published work if so desired.

1) The toppar directory will contain only the parameters released with
the current version of charmm.  Note that the all22 topology and
parameter filenames will not change with new versions of charmm as of
the c22g5_c23f2 release.  Information on dates and parameter
development associated version numbers will be placed in the
individual file headers.  Parameter development version numbers will
be maintained separately from the charmm version number to accomodate
the lack of change in a particular file between different versions of
charmm. Topology and parameter files that are coupled will have the
same version numbers.  In this system the charmm parameters will be
updated only when a new version of charmm is released.  The interested
user can get information on intermediate developments in the
parameters by contacting MacKerell at the address given below.

2) A history of changes to the parameters, see below, will be included
with the toppar directory in the file toppar_all.history.  This will
contain general information on changes between consecutive versions of
the parameters.  The user may "diff" files of interest to obtain the
exact changes made.  Details of the motivation behind these changes
may be obtained from MacKerell at the address given below.

3) A toppar_history directory tree will be incorporated into the
support directory.  Subdirectories will be named based on the
different versions of charmm.  Some subdirectory names will contain
more than one charmm version descriptor.  This will occur only when
those versions have been released simultaneously, such that the
parameters are identical.  Once a toppar_history subdirectory has
been created it will never be altered.

4) current subdirectories in toppar_history

 support/toppar_history/c22g2_g3_g4_c23a1_a2_f1
   => from versions c22g2, c22g3, c22g4, c23a1, c23a2 and c23f1

 support/toppar_history/c22g5_c23f2
   => from versions c22g5 and c23f2

5) Extended atom parameter sets for proteins and nucleic acids
(toph19.inp, param19.inp, toprna10r_22.inp and pardna10_22.inp) are
included in the toppar directory.  These parameters are stable, have
been used in a wide variety of systems and are of use in both vacuum
(with r dielectric) and in condensed phase simulations.
