Recent advances in the development of empirical force field parameters
have led to frequent updates of the all-hydrogen (all22) parameter
sets supplied with charmm.  Currently, the all-hydrogen parameters are
updated with the release of every version of charmm.  In order to
allow the user to remain current with the evolution of the parameters
and to obtain parameters from previously released versions of charmm
the following procedure in being instituted as of January 1994,
coinciding with the release of charmm versions c23f3 and c24a1.  This
system will also allow users in publicatons to specify the version of
charmm from which the parameters were obtained.  Other users will then
be able to readily obtain the particular version of the parameters and
reproduce the published work if so desired.

1) The toppar directory will contain only the parameters released with
the current version of charmm.  Note that the all22 topology and
parameter filenames will not change with new versions of charmm as of
the c22g5_c23f2 release.  Information on dates and parameter
development associated version numbers will be placed in the
individual file headers.  Parameter development version numbers will
be maintained separately from the charmm version number to accomodate
the lack of change in a particular file between different versions of
charmm. Topology and parameter files that are coupled will have the
same version numbers.  In this system the charmm parameters will be
updated only when a new version of charmm is released.  The interested
user can get information on intermediate developments in the
parameters by contacting MacKerell at the address given below.

2) A history of changes to the parameters, see below, will be included
with the toppar directory in the file toppar_all.history.  This will
contain general information on changes between consecutive versions of
the parameters.  The user may "diff" files of interest to obtain the
exact changes made.  Details of the motivation behind these changes
may be obtained from MacKerell at the address given below.

3) A toppar_history directory tree will be incorporated into the
support directory.  Subdirectories will be named based on the
different versions of charmm.  Some subdirectory names will contain
more than one charmm version descriptor.  This will occur only when
those versions have been released simultaneously, such that the
parameters are identical.  Once a toppar_history subdirectory has
been created it will never be altered.

4) current subdirectories in toppar_history

 toppar/toppar_history/c22g2_g3_g4_c23a1_a2_f1
   => from versions c22g2, c22g3, c22g4, c23a1, c23a2 and c23f1
 toppar/toppar_history/c22g5_c23a2_f2
   => from versions c22g5 and c23f2
 toppar/toppar_history/c23f3_f4_f5_c24a1_a2_a3
   => from versions c23f3, c23f4, c23f5, c24a1, c24a2 and c24a3
 toppar/toppar_history/c24b1
   => from version c24b1
 toppar/toppar_history/c24b2_g1_g2_c25a0_a1_a2_a3
   => from versions c24b2, c24g1, c24g2, c25a0, c25a1, c25a2 and c25a3
 toppar/toppar_history/c25b1_b2_c26a1_a2
   => from versions c25b1, c25b2, c26a1 and c26a2

5) Extended atom parameter sets for proteins and nucleic acids
(toph19.inp, param19.inp, toprna10r_22.inp and pardna10_22.inp) are
included in the toppar directory.  These parameters are stable, have
been used in a wide variety of systems and are of use in both vacuum
(with r dielectric) and in condensed phase simulations.

6) Parameter set for analysis of hydrogen bonds (par_hbond.inp) added
in July 1997 and all hbond parameters removed from the all-hydrogen
parameter files.  Note that the parameters in par_hbond.inp are for
analysis only.  Using them for energy, minimization and dynamics
calculations with give INCORRECT results.

Summary of c24b2_g1_g2_c25a0_a1_a2_a3 to c25b1/c26a1 topology and
parameter file changes. July 1997

Changes annotated with * will have an effect on
calculated energies and forces of the related compounds.

All the all-hydrogen topology files have been modified for use with
MMFF.  This includes addition of atomic type to MASS list,
specification of DOUBLE and TRIPLE bonds where appropriate and
addition of the TP3M MMFF water model.  No changes required in the
parameter files.  Note that these changes allow the CHARMM
all-hydrogen topology/parameter files to be used with the MMFF
facilities.  Note that the CHARMM all-hydrogen parameters are NOT
designed to be compatible with the MMFF parameters.  Use CHARMM with
MMFF parameters at your own risk.

The hbond parameters in all-hydrogen parameter files have been removed
simplied and a new parameter file, par_hbond.inp, added.  This may be
used for hbond analysis.  Note that the parameters in par_hbond.inp
are for analysis only.  Using them for energy, minimization and
dynamics calculations with give INCORRECT results.

Cutnb has been increased to 14.0 A in the all-hydrogen parameter files
to produce 2 A buffer region (ctonb is 12.0 A) optimal for heuristic
list updating.

proteins (also the top_all22_model.inp file):

  1) dihedral parameters for neutral glycine and glycine dipeptide added

nucleic acids: 

  1) PRES 3MET, 3'terminal Methyl patch added

  2) PRES NOBA, patch to delete all base atoms added.

  3) RESI NDPH, residue for reduced NADPH added. No NADP+ yet available.

lipids: 

  1) additional parameters for double bonds added. 

  2) 2-hexene added.

  *3) Additional NBFIXes associated with sodium (SOD), potassium (K) and
  magnesium (MG) added to make them consistent with nucleic acids (for
  Mg) and Benoit Roux's thesis (for SOD and K).  Changes also made in
  the combined protein_lipid files.  Energetics involving these ions
  will be effected by these additions.

Summary of c25b1/c26a1 to c26b1 topology and parameter file changes.
September 1998

Changes in the all topology and parameter files involved only bugfixes
and minor additions or corrections, as outlined below.

Changes annotated with * will have an effect on
calculated energies and forces of the related compounds.

1) Appropriate references added to initial portions of all files.

2) Detailed description of the form and variables of each of the
energy terms added in all files.

proteins:

  no changes

nucleic acids:

  1) minor corrections to NAD etc. IC tables

  2) RESI NADP, residue for oxidized NADP+ added.

lipids:

  *1) Correction to alkene parameters.  Includes additional refinement to
  improve agreement with a.i. for -C=C- surface.  See alkene reference.

  2) Commented parameters associated with ions removed.

par_hbond.inp

  1) Hbond parameters corrected to cover all (hopefully) possibilities.

toph19.inp

  1) Version number changed to 22 to maintain compatibility

Addition of new lipid and nucleic acid topology and parameter (all27)
files to c27a1.  These parameters will only be included in the
developmental version of Charmm27 to allow for testing.  

September, 1998

nucleic acids:

  1) The all27 nucleic acid parameters represent a complete overhall
of the Charmm22 nucleic acid parameters.  This was performed to
correct problems with the equilibrium between the A and B forms of DNA
as well as take advantage of an extensive amount of new experimental
and ab initio data on nucleic acid model compounds.  Manuscript
preparation is in progress with submission expected by the end of
1998.

  2) Alternate nucleic acid bases (5-methylcytosine, inosine) and
other compounds (ATP, NAD etc.) are effected by the changes such that
published data on these compounds cannot be exactly reproduced using
the all27 parameter set.  Tests and parameter reoptimization by adm
jr. have been performed in order to insure consistency with published
works.

lipids:

  1) New alkane LJ and dihedral parameters.  The LJ parameters have
been optimized to more accurately reproduce experimental condensed
phase properties (Yin and MacKerell) and the dihedral parameters have
been optimized to lower the butane CCCC gauche energy to 0.63
kcal/mole.  

  2) New phosphate charges and dihedral parameters to better reproduce
interactions of DMP with water and DMP conformational energetics.

proteins:

  1) No all27 protein parameter set is available as of Sept. 98.
Based on the changes in the nucleic acid and lipid files it is
expected that the protein all22 parameters will be compatible with the
all27 nucleic acid and lipid parameters, however, no explicit tests
have been performed to date.  The statement that compatibility can be
expected is based on the maintainence of the all22 parameter
optimization philosophy during the optimization of the all 27
parameters.  Please contact adm jr. for more details.
