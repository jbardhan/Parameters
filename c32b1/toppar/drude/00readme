Toppar files for polarizable model based on the classical Drude
oscillator.

July 2005
adm jr.

The files in this directory and subdirectories are designed based on
the implementation of the Drude code in version c32 of charmm.  It is
expected (essential) that the format of these files will be altered in
future releases to facilitate use of the polarizable Drude model.  

top_drude_jul05.inp: includes MASS specifications for all atoms
currently supported by the Drude model along with RESIdues for the
alkanes rare gases and dummy atoms. Note that the residues in this
file are not complete.  The additional information along with
additional residues are in the str directory.

par_drude_jul05.inp: includes parameters for all atoms currently
supported by the Drude model, including LJ terms.

str subdirectory: stream files required to assign correct charges and
polarizabilities along with information for additional residues.

buta_setpol_cf1g.str: butane
deca_setpol_cf1g.str: decane
etha_setpol_cf1g.str: ethane
hept_setpol_cf1g.str: heptane
hexa_setpol_cf1g.str: hexane
ibut_setpol_cf1g.str: isobutane
pend_setpol_cf1g.str: pentadecane
pent_setpol_cf1g.str: pentane
prop_setpol_cf1g.str: propane
swm4_dp_setpol_negative.str: SWM4-DP water with negative drude
swm4_dp_setpol_positive.str: SWM4-DP water with positive drude
ions_setpol.str: ions, use with swm4_dp_setpol_positive.str

test subdirectory: testcases to generate above residues and calculate
energies.
